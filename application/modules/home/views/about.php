                            	Make Africa Great Again is a non-profit charitable organization created with a main aim of enhancing sustainable and significant development in Africa. Our major focus is ensuring that we change destinies, lives and nations through reaching out to millions of individuals who need help in various parts of the beautiful African continent.

                            </p>

                            <p>

                            	We will offer grants, scholarships, solar lights (to enhance continuous studying of kids even at night), clean water infrastructure, fund health camps and programs, provide mosquito nets (to help prevent children and other people from contracting malaria), orphan care, microfinance loans and even disaster relief. This will help us achieve our aim of ensuring that Africans are self-sufficient and reliant and break away from the chains of poverty and lead better lives. 

                            </p>

								We believe that with the empowerment and enlightening of the millions of individuals we will reach out to, we will have paid a great debt that the world owes Africa; support to grow and reach where its brothers like Europe and America have reached. We know it will not be easy but with our hard working and able team in place, MAGA movement, we believe that somewhere in Africa, an individual will be touched and their lives will change completely for the better.

						    </div>

							<p>

								Our organization was created out of our love for humanity and the belief that Africa is the richest continent on earth in terms of resources, thus all its people should live the lives that they deserve, lives that reflect the true state of Africa’s richness. Many African countries have natural resources like Oil, Diamond and Gold, but the lack of political goodwill and stability have held the richest continent at ransom.

							</p>

							<p>

								Bad leadership and corruption have plunged millions of innocent lives into chaos that they cannot get out of, but we believe that if they are enlightened, they will get many choices to make their lives better.

								This will help sort out leadership issues for the future, hence ensure that the resources that the continent has go directly to benefit all people and not a few greedy individuals. Through grants and loans, we will empower the society with the ability to start their own businesses and development projects that will improve their livelihoods. We will travel and go to the deepest of regions that have been barely explored and ensure that we leave a lasting mark on the people.
